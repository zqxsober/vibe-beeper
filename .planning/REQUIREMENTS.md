# Requirements: CC-Beeper (Claumagotchi)

**Defined:** 2026-03-24
**Core Value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow

## v3.0 Requirements

Requirements for Public Launch milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Onboarding

- [ ] **ONBD-01**: Welcome screen with illustration, title, description of what CC-Beeper does, and "Get Started" button
- [ ] **ONBD-02**: Step 1 — Scan for Claude Code CLI + hooks installation. Shows toggle that turns green when detected/installed
- [ ] **ONBD-03**: Step 2 — Permissions: Voice/Microphone/Accessibility with toggles that redirect to System Settings and turn green when granted. User can skip and do later
- [ ] **ONBD-04**: Step 3 — Download premium voices with link to System Settings > Spoken Content
- [ ] **ONBD-05**: Success screen — "All set! Restart Claude Code to activate hooks"
- [ ] **ONBD-06**: App installs to /Applications on first launch (wherever DMG was opened from)
- [ ] **ONBD-07**: Menu bar "Setup..." entry re-opens onboarding wizard

### Menu Bar (Popover)

- [ ] **MENU-01**: Click menu bar icon opens rich popover panel (replaces dropdown menu)
- [ ] **MENU-02**: Quick toggles at top of popover: YOLO mode, mute/sound, hide widget, quit
- [ ] **MENU-03**: Advanced settings section: theme picker, dark mode, auto-speak, vibration, notifications
- [ ] **MENU-04**: Permissions section with live status toggles (re-trigger from here)
- [ ] **MENU-05**: About section with version, GitHub link
- [ ] **MENU-06**: "Setup..." and "Download Voices..." entries in popover

### Code Quality

- [x] **CODE-01**: All hardcoded `/Users/vcartier/` fallback paths removed from image loaders
- [x] **CODE-02**: Old egg shell assets (shell-*.png) deleted from Sources/shells/
- [x] **CODE-03**: All compiler warnings fixed (Sendable closures, unused variables)
- [x] **CODE-04**: Vibration/buzz logic extracted into dedicated BuzzService
- [x] **CODE-05**: Clean file organization (one type per file, consistent naming)

### Distribution

- [ ] **DIST-01**: DMG package builds via `make dmg` with app icon and /Applications symlink
- [ ] **DIST-02**: GitHub Release workflow with DMG artifact upload
- [ ] **DIST-03**: Notarization via `notarytool` so Gatekeeper doesn't block the app
- [ ] **DIST-04**: Auto-copy to /Applications on first launch

### GitHub

- [ ] **GH-01**: Landing-style README with hero GIF showing the beeper in action
- [ ] **GH-02**: Feature grid with icons (monitoring, voice, permissions, themes)
- [ ] **GH-03**: One-liner install command + DMG download link
- [ ] **GH-04**: Screenshots of all shell color themes
- [ ] **GH-05**: Contributing guide and license

### Visual Polish

- [ ] **VFX-01**: Smooth state transitions on LCD (fade between states, not instant swap)
- [ ] **VFX-02**: Dark mode shell variants render correctly with LCD overlay
- [ ] **VFX-03**: Consistent button press feedback across all buttons

### Voice

- [ ] **VOICE-05**: Voice recording uses Groq Whisper API (WAV file → API → text) instead of SFSpeech
- [ ] **VOICE-06**: API key stored in macOS Keychain (prompted during onboarding if voice enabled)
- [ ] **VOICE-07**: Summary flow: manual "Summarize" button when Claude finishes, not just auto-speak

## Future Requirements

### Post-Launch

- **POST-01**: Homebrew tap (`brew install cc-beeper`)
- **POST-02**: Per-project settings
- **POST-03**: Hotkey remapping
- **POST-04**: Conversation history panel
- **POST-05**: Custom TTS voice selection

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| iOS/iPad companion | macOS only |
| App Store distribution | GitHub + DMG for v3.0 |
| BYOK API keys (beyond Groq) | Groq free tier sufficient |
| External TTS (OpenAI, ElevenLabs) | Ava Premium is adequate |
| Dropdown menu | Replaced by popover panel |
