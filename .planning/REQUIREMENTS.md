# Requirements: CC-Beeper v7.0

**Defined:** 2026-03-29
**Core Value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow

## v7.0 Requirements

### HTTP Hooks

- [x] **HTTP-01**: CC-Beeper runs a local HTTP server (NWListener, localhost only) that receives Claude Code hook events via POST /hook
- [x] **HTTP-02**: Hook events are routed by `hook_event_name` field to the state machine (PreToolUse → thinking, Stop → finished, StopFailure → finished, Notification → needsYou). LCD state names expand in Phase 36
- [x] **HTTP-03**: The active server port is written to `~/.claude/cc-beeper/port` on startup and deleted on quit
- [x] **HTTP-04**: On Stop events, CC-Beeper extracts `last_assistant_message` directly from the Stop payload for TTS summary, replacing the old Python summary extraction
- [x] **HTTP-05**: The old Python hook script (cc-beeper-hook.py), JSONL file watcher, and file-based IPC code are removed from the codebase
- [x] **HTTP-06**: Hook commands in settings.json use `curl -d @-` to pipe stdin JSON to CC-Beeper's HTTP endpoint, with `-o /dev/null` and `|| true` for silent failure

### LCD States

- [ ] **LCD-01**: The beeper displays 6 distinct states: IDLE, WORKING, APPROVE?, NEEDS INPUT, ERROR, DONE — each with state-specific title text (THINKING dropped per CONTEXT.md D-01)
- [ ] **LCD-02**: WORKING state shows tool context as scrolling text (e.g., "WORKING: npm test", "WORKING: Reading auth.ts"), truncated to 30 chars
- [ ] **LCD-03**: APPROVE? state shows permission context (e.g., "APPROVE? rm -rf dist"), truncated to 30 chars
- [ ] **LCD-04**: ERROR state shows error context from StopFailure payload (e.g., "ERROR: Rate limited")
- [ ] **LCD-05**: DONE state auto-transitions to IDLE after 180 seconds (3 minutes, per CONTEXT.md D-20)
- [ ] **LCD-06**: State priority is enforced: ERROR > APPROVE? > NEEDS INPUT > WORKING > THINKING > DONE > IDLE — lower-priority events don't overwrite higher-priority states
- [ ] **LCD-07**: Auth success/error notifications display as transient flashes (2-3s) over the current state without changing the state machine

### Input vs Permission

- [ ] **INP-01**: Notification payloads are classified as permission (tool approval) or input (question/discussion/multiple choice) based on the notification type field
- [ ] **INP-02**: In Guarded YOLO and Full YOLO modes, permission notifications are suppressed (LCD stays on current state), but input notifications always show NEEDS INPUT
- [ ] **INP-03**: Unknown notification types default to NEEDS INPUT (visible) — false positives over false negatives

### Permission Spectrum

- [x] **PERM-01**: The native MenuBarExtra menu contains 4 permission presets (Cautious, Relaxed, Trusted, YOLO) shown inline with descriptions and a checkmark on the current mode
- [x] **PERM-02**: Selecting a preset reads settings.json, writes `permission_mode` and `allowedTools` atomically (tmp + rename) without reformatting other fields
- [x] **PERM-03**: On mode change, the LCD shows a toast overlay "RESTART SESSION TO APPLY" for 5 seconds
- [x] **PERM-04**: Each preset shows an inline description explaining what it auto-approves
- [x] **PERM-05**: The old YOLO toggle in MenuBarExtra and YOLO QuickActionButton in the popover are removed, replaced by the preset picker
- [x] **PERM-06**: If settings.json is malformed, the preset picker items are disabled with a warning

### YOLO Indicator

- [x] **YOLO-01**: When permission preset is YOLO, the beeper character renders with a rabbit pixel icon, persisting across all LCD states
- [x] **YOLO-02**: Rabbit appears/disappears with a simple swap on mode change (no animation)

### LCD Animations

- [ ] **ANIM-01**: Each LCD state has a distinct animation: IDLE (static), THINKING (slow pulse), WORKING (marquee scroll), APPROVE? (fast blink), NEEDS INPUT (slow blink), ERROR (flash then hold), DONE (brief flash then fade) — LCD color stays consistent with theme, no per-state color changes
- [ ] **ANIM-02**: APPROVE? and NEEDS INPUT are distinguishable at a glance by different blink speeds and text

### Hook Improvements

- [x] **HOOK-01**: All CC-Beeper async hook entries in settings.json have `async: true` and `timeout: 5` (seconds, not milliseconds per research correction)
- [x] **HOOK-02**: Only the PreToolUse hook has `statusMessage: "CC-Beeper monitoring…"`
- [x] **HOOK-03**: All hook commands produce zero stdout output under all conditions (CC-Beeper running, not running, port file missing)
- [x] **HOOK-04**: CC-Beeper hooks are identified in settings.json by matching `cc-beeper` in the command string, enabling safe update/removal without touching user hooks


### Onboarding

- [ ] **ONBD-01**: Onboarding detects and migrates old JSONL-based CC-Beeper hooks to HTTP hooks, with user confirmation and "What this changes" expandable detail
- [ ] **ONBD-02**: Onboarding starts the HTTP server and confirms it's listening before completing
- [ ] **ONBD-03**: Existing voice, language, and model download onboarding steps are preserved
- [ ] **ONBD-04**: If settings.json is malformed, onboarding shows a clear error and does not attempt to write to it

### README

- [ ] **GH-01**: README opens with a hero GIF showing the beeper reacting to a live Claude Code session (IDLE → THINKING → WORKING → APPROVE? → DONE cycle)
- [ ] **GH-02**: README includes feature highlights with inline screenshots: LCD status, permission mode toggle, YOLO sunglasses, menu bar presence
- [ ] **GH-03**: README includes install instructions (Homebrew + DMG fallback), setup overview, how-it-works technical paragraph, and uninstall guide


## v8+ Requirements

Deferred to future release.

- **FUTURE-01**: Switchboard window (hooks/guards/automations GUI)
- **FUTURE-02**: Guidelines editor for ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- **FUTURE-03**: Per-project hooks/settings management
- **FUTURE-04**: Proactive behavior-based nudges

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Switchboard / hooks management GUI | CC-Beeper is a monitoring layer, not a config manager |
| Guard/automation presets | No bundled hook scripts in v7.0 |
| Guidelines editor | CLAUDE.md editing belongs in terminal/editor |
| Per-project settings | Ship with global settings first |
| iOS/iPad companion | macOS only |
| App Store distribution | GitHub + DMG for now |
