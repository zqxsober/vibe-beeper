# Requirements: CC-Beeper

**Defined:** 2026-03-24 | **Updated:** 2026-03-27
**Core Value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow

## v3.0 Requirements

Requirements for Public Launch milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Onboarding

- [x] **ONBD-01**: Welcome screen with illustration, title, description of what CC-Beeper does, and "Get Started" button
- [x] **ONBD-02**: Step 1 — Scan for Claude Code CLI + hooks installation. Shows toggle that turns green when detected/installed
- [x] **ONBD-03**: Step 2 — Permissions: Voice/Microphone/Accessibility with toggles that redirect to System Settings and turn green when granted. User can skip and do later
- [x] **ONBD-04**: Step 3 — Download premium voices with link to System Settings > Spoken Content
- [x] **ONBD-05**: Success screen — "All set! Restart Claude Code to activate hooks"
- [x] **ONBD-06**: App installs to /Applications on first launch (wherever DMG was opened from)
- [x] **ONBD-07**: Menu bar "Setup..." entry re-opens onboarding wizard

### Menu Bar (Popover)

- [x] **MENU-01**: Click menu bar icon opens rich popover panel (replaces dropdown menu)
- [x] **MENU-02**: Quick toggles at top of popover: YOLO mode, mute/sound, hide widget, quit
- [x] **MENU-03**: Advanced settings section: theme picker, dark mode, auto-speak, vibration, notifications
- [x] **MENU-04**: Permissions section with live status toggles (re-trigger from here)
- [x] **MENU-05**: About section with version, GitHub link
- [x] **MENU-06**: "Setup..." and "Download Voices..." entries in popover

### Code Quality

- [x] **CODE-01**: All hardcoded `/Users/vcartier/` fallback paths removed from image loaders
- [x] **CODE-02**: Old egg shell assets (shell-*.png) deleted from Sources/shells/
- [x] **CODE-03**: All compiler warnings fixed (Sendable closures, unused variables)
- [x] **CODE-04**: Vibration/buzz logic extracted into dedicated BuzzService
- [x] **CODE-05**: Clean file organization (one type per file, consistent naming)

### Distribution

- [x] **DIST-01**: DMG package builds via `make dmg` with app icon and /Applications symlink
- [x] **DIST-02**: GitHub Release workflow with DMG artifact upload
- [x] **DIST-03**: Notarization via `notarytool` so Gatekeeper doesn't block the app
- [x] **DIST-04**: Auto-copy to /Applications on first launch

### GitHub

- [x] **GH-01**: Landing-style README with hero GIF showing the beeper in action
- [x] **GH-02**: Feature grid with icons (monitoring, voice, permissions, themes)
- [x] **GH-03**: One-liner install command + DMG download link
- [x] **GH-04**: Screenshots of all shell color themes
- [x] **GH-05**: Contributing guide and license

### Visual Polish

- [x] **VFX-01**: Smooth state transitions on LCD (fade between states, not instant swap)
- [x] **VFX-02**: Dark mode shell variants render correctly with LCD overlay
- [x] **VFX-03**: Consistent button press feedback across all buttons

### Voice

- [x] **VOICE-05**: Voice recording uses Groq Whisper API (WAV file → API → text) instead of SFSpeech
- [x] **VOICE-06**: API key stored in macOS Keychain (prompted during onboarding if voice enabled)
- [x] **VOICE-07**: Summary flow: manual "Summarize" button when Claude finishes, not just auto-speak

## v3.1 Requirements

Requirements for Polish & Fixes milestone.

### Cleanup

- [x] **CLN-01**: All Claumagotchi references removed from laptop (old .app in /Applications, Desktop PNG assets, .claude/memory entries)
- [x] **CLN-02**: Zero "Claumagotchi" mentions remain in the CC-Beeper codebase (code, comments, configs, scripts)

### GitHub Presence

- [x] **GH2-01**: README uses the new multi-shell cover image as hero
- [x] **GH2-02**: README copy is rewritten — exciting, concise, zero Claumagotchi mentions
- [x] **GH2-03**: GitHub repo description and metadata updated to match new branding

### Bug Fixes

- [x] **FIX-01**: Auto-speak TTS works end-to-end — Claude Code stops → summary-hook fires → TTS speaks the summary
- [x] **FIX-02**: TTS falls back gracefully (OpenAI TTS if key set, Apple Ava if not)

### Branding

- [x] **BRD-01**: Menu bar icon is a beeper-shaped silhouette (replaces current icon)
- ~~**BRD-02**: Custom app icon integrated (user provides Figma export)~~ — deferred to future milestone
- ~~**BRD-03**: DMG window uses CC-Beeper branding (volume name, background if provided)~~ — deferred to future milestone

## v4.0 Requirements

Requirements for Offline Voice milestone.

### License

- [ ] **LIC-01**: LICENSE file switched to GPL-3.0, README badge updated, any MIT references removed

### Offline STT

- [ ] **STT-01**: FluidAudio added as SPM dependency with Parakeet TDT CoreML model
- [x] **STT-02**: VoiceService uses Parakeet TDT for transcription by default (no API key needed)
- [x] **STT-03**: SFSpeechRecognizer kept as fallback if FluidAudio model fails to load

### Offline TTS

- [ ] **TTS-01**: Kokoro-82M CoreML model integrated via FluidAudio for spoken output
- [ ] **TTS-02**: TTSService uses Kokoro as default TTS (no API key needed)
- [ ] **TTS-03**: Apple Ava Premium / system voice kept as fallback

### Cleanup

- [ ] **CLN2-01**: Groq/OpenAI API key fields removed from Settings and Onboarding
- [ ] **CLN2-02**: KeychainService API key storage removed (no longer needed)
- [ ] **CLN2-03**: GroqTranscriptionService and OpenAI/Groq TTS paths removed from codebase

## Future Requirements

### Post-Launch

- **POST-01**: Homebrew tap (`brew install cc-beeper`)
- **POST-02**: Per-project settings
- **POST-03**: Hotkey remapping
- **POST-04**: Conversation history panel
- **POST-05**: Custom TTS voice selection
- **BRD-02**: Custom app icon (user provides Figma export) — deferred from v3.1
- **BRD-03**: DMG branded background and window layout — deferred from v3.1

|---------|--------|
| iOS/iPad companion | macOS only |
| App Store distribution | GitHub + DMG for v3.0 |
| FluidVoice full app | Using FluidAudio SPM package instead (models only) |
