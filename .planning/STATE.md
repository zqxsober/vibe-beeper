# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow
**Current focus:** Defining v2.0 requirements

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (roadmap created)
Plan: —
Status: Ready for phase planning
Last activity: 2026-03-22 — Roadmap created (5 phases, 18 requirements)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.1 complete: All 4 phases shipped (hardening, reliability, UX, notifications)
- v2.0 previously attempted (phases 5-8) and reverted — voice/settings/summary unreliable
- VoiceLoop prototype validates: voice input, auto-speak, hook-based summary, CGEvent injection
- Lessons: use regular window (not NSPanel), nil audio format, Apple Dev signing, nil CGEvent source

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Audio engine corruption from rapid start/stop — mitigated by recreating AVAudioEngine each session
- Accessibility permission requires Apple Development signing to persist across rebuilds
- Apple Intelligence availability varies — need graceful fallback when unavailable

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-21
