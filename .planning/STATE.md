# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 31 — kokoro-multilingual

## Current Position

Phase: 31 (kokoro-multilingual) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v6.0 planning]: Whisper (whisper.cpp) chosen over Parakeet for STT — multilingual (99 languages), auto-detect, batch mode acceptable for push-to-talk UX
- [v6.0 planning]: Kokoro lang_code expansion — 'a' (American), 'b' (British), 'f' (French), 'j' (Japanese), 'z' (Chinese) supported by Kokoro-82M
- [v6.0 planning]: Voice/language selection added to onboarding flow — new step between model download and done
- [v6.0 planning]: Phase 30 (Whisper) and Phase 31 (Kokoro Multilingual) are independent — can execute in parallel
- [Phase 30-whisper-stt]: FluidAudio pinned to 0.12.4 to resolve swift-transformers conflict with WhisperKit 0.17.0 (FluidAudio 0.13.x requires 1.2+, WhisperKit requires 1.1.x)
- [Phase 30-whisper-stt]: WhisperKit 0.17.0 transcribe(audioArray:) returns [TranscriptionResult] not TranscriptionResult? — use .first to get result
- [Phase 30-whisper-stt]: whisperModelSize stored as @Published String in ClaudeMonitor for SwiftUI binding compatibility; pre-warm reads self.whisperModelSize for consistency
- [Phase 31-01]: KModel shared across language switches for sub-1s latency (0.77s measured vs 1.75s full reload)
- [Phase 31-01]: LANG: command follows same stdin protocol as existing VOICE: command
- [Phase 31-01]: kokoroLangCode defaults to 'a' (American English) until Phase 32 sets it from system language
- [Phase 31-02]: Auto-voice-select on language change delegated to ClaudeMonitor.kokoroLangCode.didSet (no UI logic needed)
- [Phase 31-02]: depsReady @State defaults to true to avoid flicker on app launch; checkDeps() called on language change

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 29 (Distribution, v5.0) still in progress — Phase 30/31 depend on it. Confirm Phase 29 is complete before starting v6.0.
