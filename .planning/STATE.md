# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 35 — http-hooks-hook-improvements

## Current Position

Phase: 35 (http-hooks-hook-improvements) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-29

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v7.0 phases, 7 phases total)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed (prior milestones): 39
- Average duration: ~30 min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v7.0 start]: HTTP hooks use NWListener (localhost only); port written to ~/.claude/cc-beeper/port on startup, deleted on quit
- [v7.0 start]: Hook commands use curl -d @- to pipe stdin JSON, -o /dev/null, || true for silent failure
- [v7.0 start]: YOLO modes split: Guarded YOLO (bypass + deny preserved) vs Full YOLO (bypass + deny cleared); deny rules cached to cached-deny-rules.json
- [v7.0 start]: LCD priority enforced: ERROR > APPROVE? > NEEDS INPUT > WORKING > THINKING > DONE > IDLE
- [v7.0 start]: Input vs permission classification: unknown notification types default to NEEDS INPUT (false positives over false negatives)
- [v7.0 start]: Phase 36 and 37 can run in parallel (both depend on Phase 35 but touch independent subsystems)
- [v7.0 planning]: Phase 36 needs read-only permission_mode check from settings.json for YOLO suppression — lightweight utility, not the full spectrum UI from Phase 37
- [v7.0 planning]: TTS transcript parsing (HTTP-04) may need its own plan if transcript JSON is complex — scope during Phase 35 planning
- [v7.0 planning]: Port collision detection in Phase 35 — ping existing port file, show "already running" or clean stale file
- [v7.0 planning]: Onboarding must handle partially-modified CC-Beeper hooks (flag, don't silently overwrite)
- [v7.0 planning]: Input types (gsd, discuss, multiple_choice, wcv, question) are NEVER suppressed in YOLO — only permission/tool approval notifications are suppressible
- [Phase 35-01]: NWListener port range 19222-19230 with OS fallback; failure detected via stateUpdateHandler not thrown exceptions
- [Phase 35-01]: Permission connection deferred: store NWConnection on permission_prompt, respond via sendPermissionResponse()
- [Phase 35-01]: PID-based instance detection replaced with port ping; stale port file cleaned up on launch
- [Phase 35-http-hooks-hook-improvements]: deinit actor isolation: httpServer.stop() moved to applicationWillTerminate since deinit is nonisolated and HTTPHookServer is @MainActor
- [Phase 35-http-hooks-hook-improvements]: sessionLastSeen dict replaces sessions.json pruning in ClaudeMonitor - HTTP server tracks session lifecycle naturally from arriving events

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 33 (v6.0 Settings & Onboarding) is still not started — does not block v7.0 phases, which start at 34
