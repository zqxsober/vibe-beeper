# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing and respond to permission requests without leaving their workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — notifications

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (notifications) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: ~4 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-hardening | 2 | ~4 min | ~2 min |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-hardening P01 | 6 | 3 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 02-reliability-performance P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 02-reliability-performance P01 | 4 | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 03-ux-enhancements P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 03-ux-enhancements P02 | 3min | 1 task | 2 files |
| Phase 04-notifications P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Roadmap: Bug fixes and security grouped into Phase 1 (BUG-03 and SEC-01 are the same default-deny fix)
- Roadmap: Reliability and Performance grouped into Phase 2 (both invisible, stabilize before UX lifts)
- Roadmap: Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 (window lookup fix in BUG-02 required for stable global hotkeys)
- Roadmap: Notifications are Phase 4 — standalone subsystem, naturally last
- 01-02: Default decision changed from allow to deny — hook fails closed on any ambiguous data (BUG-03/SEC-01)
- 01-02: 2-second mtime tolerance for freshness check to account for filesystem/clock drift (SEC-03)
- 01-02: Whitelist guard normalizes non-string/unexpected decision values to deny rather than passing through
- [Phase 01-hardening]: EggIcon.image() takes EggIconState not Bool — extensible for future states
- [Phase 01-hardening]: Window lookup via identifier?.rawValue == 'main', not mutable title string
- [Phase 01-hardening]: processEvent schema validation uses is String / is Int type checks inside existing guard
- [Phase 02-reliability-performance]: Gate animFrame increment not timer - Canvas re-render is expensive, timer tick is not
- [Phase 02-reliability-performance]: Color.hexComponents() as shared helper for Color(hex:) and ThemeManager.darken() — single source of truth for hex parsing
- [Phase 02-reliability-performance]: 0.5s restart delay gives hook time to recreate events.jsonl before re-opening fd
- [Phase 02-reliability-performance]: 30-second prune throttle for sessions.json disk reads; session_end resets to distantPast for immediate accuracy
- [Phase 02-reliability-performance]: DispatchWorkItem replaces Timer.scheduledTimer: no RunLoop dependency, clean cancellation
- [Phase 03-ux-enhancements]: sessionCount updated at all 4 mutation sites for accuracy
- [Phase 03-ux-enhancements]: Idle timer transitions to .idle not .finished — distinct sleeping state
- [Phase 03-ux-enhancements]: Full path left-truncated at 40 chars preserving meaningful filename end
- [Phase 03-ux-enhancements]: Global + local monitor pair covers any foreground app and companion window focus
- [Phase 03-ux-enhancements]: flags == .option strict equality rejects Cmd+Option and Ctrl+Option — avoids terminal conflicts
- [Phase 03-ux-enhancements]: setupGlobalHotkeys called from permission events for lazy re-install after Accessibility granted post-launch
- [Phase 04-notifications]: requestPermission() called eagerly at init to avoid missing first notification while dialog is pending
- [Phase 04-notifications]: post_tool_error separated from pre_tool/post_tool case to allow targeted notification call
- [Phase 04-notifications]: Nil-coalescing fallback for sendPermissionRequest (pendingPermission races with async loadPendingPermission retries)
- [Phase 04-notifications]: Ad-hoc signing (codesign --force --deep --sign -) sufficient for local distribution — notification authorization requires code signing
- [Phase 04-notifications]: Keyboard shortcut n for notifications toggle — no conflict with existing menu bar shortcuts
- [Phase 04-notifications]: Notifications toggle positioned immediately after sound toggle for logical media/alert grouping

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CONCERNS.md: File watcher fragility is REL-01 — high priority, app unusable after log rotation without fix
- CONCERNS.md: State machine complexity in processEvent() is untested — changes in Phase 1/2 carry regression risk
