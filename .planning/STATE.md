# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing and respond to permission requests without leaving their workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (hardening) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 (all plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: ~4 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-hardening | 2 | ~4 min | ~2 min |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-hardening P01 | 6 | 3 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Roadmap: Bug fixes and security grouped into Phase 1 (BUG-03 and SEC-01 are the same default-deny fix)
- Roadmap: Reliability and Performance grouped into Phase 2 (both invisible, stabilize before UX lifts)
- Roadmap: Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 (window lookup fix in BUG-02 required for stable global hotkeys)
- Roadmap: Notifications are Phase 4 — standalone subsystem, naturally last
- 01-02: Default decision changed from allow to deny — hook fails closed on any ambiguous data (BUG-03/SEC-01)
- 01-02: 2-second mtime tolerance for freshness check to account for filesystem/clock drift (SEC-03)
- 01-02: Whitelist guard normalizes non-string/unexpected decision values to deny rather than passing through
- [Phase 01-hardening]: EggIcon.image() takes EggIconState not Bool — extensible for future states
- [Phase 01-hardening]: Window lookup via identifier?.rawValue == 'main', not mutable title string
- [Phase 01-hardening]: processEvent schema validation uses is String / is Int type checks inside existing guard

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CONCERNS.md: File watcher fragility is REL-01 — high priority, app unusable after log rotation without fix
- CONCERNS.md: State machine complexity in processEvent() is untested — changes in Phase 1/2 carry regression risk
