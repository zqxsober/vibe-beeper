# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 39 — Functional Audit & Bug Fixes (v1.0 Public Launch, first phase)

## Current Position

Phase: 39 of 46 (Functional Audit & Bug Fixes)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-31 — Roadmap created for v1.0 Public Launch (Phases 39-46)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/8 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed (prior milestones): 67
- Average duration: ~30 min
- Trend: Stable

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Prior milestones | 67 | ~33.5 hrs | ~30 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v7.0]: HTTP hooks use NWListener (localhost only); port written to ~/.claude/cc-beeper/port on startup, deleted on quit
- [v7.0]: Hook commands use curl -d @- to pipe stdin JSON, -o /dev/null, || true for silent failure
- [v7.0]: LCD priority: ERROR > APPROVE? > INPUT? > LISTENING > SPEAKING > WORKING > DONE > IDLE
- [v7.0]: PermissionPreset enum drives all permission mode I/O
- [v7.0]: Notification hook is blocking (not async) — Claude Code routes permission_prompt via Notification
- [v1.0 start]: Functional audit (Phase 39) is the prerequisite gate — decomposing broken code makes bugs untraceable
- [v1.0 start]: Decomposition order: SessionTracker → PermissionController → HotkeyManager → HookDispatcher → ClaudeMonitor slim-down
- [v1.0 start]: HTTP auth token required (unauthenticated localhost server is a security gap)
- [v1.0 start]: Distribution Phase 45 depends on Phase 39 being audited clean, not on decomposition
- [v1.0 start]: FocusService (Phase 44) consolidates duplicated terminalBundleIDs from VoiceService + ClaudeMonitor

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 44 (FocusService): Ghostty AXUIElement tab bar element roles are undocumented — needs Accessibility Inspector inspection before implementation. Research flag from SUMMARY.md.
- Phase 44 (FocusService): Cursor bundle ID `com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92` may change with major Cursor versions — verify before shipping.
- Phase 44 (FocusService): JetBrains non-IntelliJ bundle IDs (WebStorm, GoLand, etc.) are pattern-derived — verify with `mdls` before hardcoding.
