# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 16 — Visual Polish

## Current Position

Phase: 16 (Visual Polish) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed (v3.0): 0
- Prior milestone (v2.0 Voice Loop): 6 plans across phases 9-11

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v3.0-pre: Code Beeper UI redesign done in manual session (horizontal pager, PNG buttons, 8 shells, LEDs, vibration, marquee text)
- Window-based vibration prevents sub-pixel blur on retina (not view offset)
- LED pulse uses Timer toggle (not SwiftUI animation) to avoid compositing bleed
- Voice recording switching to Groq Whisper (SFSpeechRecognizer flaky on macOS)
- DMG + GitHub Releases chosen over App Store (no overhead, broadest reach)
- [Phase 12-code-quality]: Bundle.main.resourcePath-only image loading — no fallback to developer source paths
- [Phase 12-code-quality]: Delete legacy shell-*.png (9 files) — replaced by beeper-*.png in v3 redesign
- [Phase 12-code-quality]: Package.swift exclude: shells, buttons, shell.svg — suppress 36 unhandled files warning
- [Phase 12-code-quality]: BuzzService takes vibrationEnabled/soundEnabled as parameters — no direct ClaudeMonitor reference, one-directional dependency
- [Phase 12-code-quality]: AppDelegate colocated with @main ClaumagotchiApp — acceptable exception to one-type-per-file rule
- [Phase 13-onboarding]: testTarget has no dependencies on executable target — @testable import not supported for .executableTarget; stubs use XCTest only
- [Phase 13-onboarding]: Hook script copied into Sources/ (not ../hooks/ path) — SPM resource path must be within target's path: directory
- [Phase 13-onboarding]: AppMover uses fm.copyItem as primary operation — fm.moveItem fails cross-volume from DMG
- [Phase 13-onboarding]: ClaudeDetector scans ~/.nvm/versions/node/ with contentsOfDirectory sorted newest-first — PATH in macOS app is minimal
- [Phase 13-onboarding]: NotificationManager removed in coordinated sweep: deleted file + removed 4 call sites + notificationsEnabled + Toggle from menu
- [Phase 13-onboarding]: Deep links live in OnboardingViewModel methods; step views call viewModel.open*Settings() — correct encapsulation
- [Phase 13-onboarding]: Color.accentColor (not .accent) for foregroundStyle — ShapeStyle has no .accent member on macOS 26
- [Phase 13-onboarding]: @Environment(\.openWindow) must live in App struct not AppDelegate — AppDelegate is not in the SwiftUI environment
- [Phase 14-menu-bar-popover]: MenuBarExtra uses .window style (not .menu) to render SwiftUI popover instead of native dropdown
- [Phase 14-menu-bar-popover]: Settings window scene added alongside existing main/onboarding windows with id: settings
- [Phase 14-menu-bar-popover]: Reverted to .menuBarExtraStyle(.menu) dropdown — .window popover not native-feeling on macOS
- [Phase 14-menu-bar-popover]: ClaudeMonitor permission gate checks pending.json freshness (<5s) and ignores safe tools (AskUserQuestion etc) to prevent false needsYou triggers
- [Phase 15-voice-fixes]: KeychainService as caseless enum, test file embeds stub due to @testable import unavailability for .executableTarget
- [Phase 15-voice-fixes]: Groq auth requires lowercase 'bearer' header (not 'Bearer') — critical per Groq docs to avoid 401
- [Phase 15-voice-fixes]: kSecAttrSynchronizable: false prevents third-party API keys from syncing to iCloud Keychain
- [Phase 15-voice-fixes]: Groq path skips SFSpeech entirely in startRecording — prevents timeout race between Groq transcription and 2-second SFSpeech fallback
- [Phase 15-voice-fixes]: AVAudioPlayer stored as TTSService instance property (not local) — prevents ARC deallocation during OpenAI MP3 playback
- [Phase 15-voice-fixes]: WAV recording uses native AVAudioEngine format without AVAudioConverter — Groq auto-downsamples, simplifies implementation
- [Phase 16-visual-polish]: PixelTitle LCD screen updated from CLAUMAGOTCHI to CC-BEEPER with new pixel font glyphs for B, E, P, R, dash
- [Phase 16-visual-polish]: IPC directory migration runs in applicationDidFinishLaunching before PID check — ensures existing users' data carries over to cc-beeper path
- [Phase 16-visual-polish]: Keychain migration is lazy (load-time per account, not startup sweep) — com.claumagotchi.apikeys falls back to com.vecartier.cc-beeper.apikeys
- [Phase 16-visual-polish]: SettingsTab enum placed in SettingsView.swift (not separate file) — only used by SettingsView, no external consumers
- [Phase 16-visual-polish]: Settings window frame updated to 580x420 — wider for sidebar+detail layout, shorter since only one section visible at a time

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Notarization requires Apple Developer Program ($99/yr) — may need alternative if not enrolled
- VOICE-06 (Groq API key onboarding prompt) bridges Phase 13 and 15 — Phase 13 UI wires to Phase 15 Keychain service; plan Phase 15 before finalizing Phase 13 onboarding steps
