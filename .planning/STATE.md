# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing and respond to permission requests without leaving their workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — voice-input-layout

## Current Position

Phase: 08 (voice-input-layout) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: ~30 min
- Total execution time: ~4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Hardening | 2 | ~60 min | ~30 min |
| 2. Reliability + Performance | 2 | ~60 min | ~30 min |
| 3. UX Enhancements | 2 | ~60 min | ~30 min |
| 4. Notifications | 2 | ~60 min | ~30 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v2.0:

- v1.1 complete: All 4 phases shipped, 20 requirements, codebase now ~1500 LOC Swift
- Accessibility permission already granted (global hotkeys) — voice input SFSpeechRecognizer can reuse this path
- No external dependencies constraint still applies — SFSpeechRecognizer and Keychain are system frameworks
- Settings Window (Phase 5) must come before AI Summary (Phase 7) — API key entry is a hard dependency
- Activity Feed (Phase 6) must come before AI Summary (Phase 7) — summaries are built from feed data
- [Phase 05-settings-window]: Used custom Window scene (id: settings) not SwiftUI Settings scene — openSettings broken on macOS 26 Tahoe
- [Phase 05-settings-window]: Keychain upsert via SecItemDelete+SecItemAdd (not SecItemUpdate) — simpler, avoids query/attributes split
- [Phase 05-settings-window]: Anthropic 529 mapped to networkError not invalid — temporary overload is not a key validity signal
- [Phase 05-settings-window]: Tab API (not tabItem) for SettingsView TabView; no tabViewStyle modifier to avoid sidebarAdaptable pitfall on macOS 26
- [Phase 05-settings-window]: Menu bar cleaned to status/permissions/YOLO/Settings/Show-Hide/Quit — all preference controls now exclusively in Settings window
- [Phase 06-activity-feed]: Only pre_tool events create ActivityEntry records (not post_tool) to avoid duplicates; post_tool_error records with isError=true
- [Phase 06-activity-feed]: 200-entry cap per session bounds memory; 5-minute delayed cleanup after session_end preserves feed for UI
- [Phase 06-activity-feed]: Shell extracted to tamagotchiShell @ViewBuilder property — isolates feed changes from shell layout
- [Phase 06-activity-feed]: Feed panel fixed at 200x120pt with LCD theme colors; window grows 300->430pt via showFeed animated bool
- [Phase 07-ai-summary]: SummaryService uses JSONSerialization (not Codable) to match existing codebase pattern
- [Phase 07-ai-summary]: summarizeIfConfigured tries Anthropic first — preferred provider for Claumagotchi
- [Phase 07-ai-summary]: @MainActor Task in session_end ensures @Published updates stay on main thread
- [Phase 07-ai-summary]: Summary section rendered above raw feed entries for visual prominence in the fixed-height LCD panel
- [Phase 08-voice-input-layout]: outputFormat(forBus: 0) not inputFormat in VoiceService — avoids zero-channel crash on macOS hardware
- [Phase 08-voice-input-layout]: VoiceService recreates AVAudioEngine on stopRecording() — reset() unreliable, instantiation is lightweight
- [Phase 08-voice-input-layout]: CGEvent injection chunked at 20 UTF-16 units + 10ms delay to avoid dropped characters in Terminal.app

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Voice input (Phase 8) requires simulated keystroke injection via CGEvent — needs Accessibility permission (already granted for hotkeys, but worth verifying scope)
- SFSpeechRecognizer requires microphone permission entitlement in the app sandbox/Info.plist
