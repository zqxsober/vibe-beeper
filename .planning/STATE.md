# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** Users can see what Claude is doing, respond to it, and give it instructions — without leaving their current workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 20 — Fix Auto-Speak TTS

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Phase 16]: Deep rename to CC-Beeper complete — IPC, Keychain, bundle ID all migrated
- [Phase 17]: Ad-hoc signing default; notarization opt-in (Apple Developer Program required)
- [Phase 18]: README uses vecartier/Claumagotchi repo URL for DMG link — repo rename deferred
- [Phase 18]: Cover image at docs/cover.png — committed, renders on GitHub
- [v3.1 planning]: Phase 22 (Final Branding) blocked until user provides Figma app icon export
- [Phase 19-cleanup]: feedback_claumagotchi_applications.md renamed to feedback_cc_beeper_applications.md with updated CC-Beeper build path
- [Phase 19-cleanup]: CLN-02: Zero Claumagotchi matches in all production code; migration code removed after clean break
- [Phase 20-fix-auto-speak-tts]: D-01: Merged summary extraction into cc-beeper-hook.py Stop handler — hooks/summary-hook.py deleted, HookInstaller unchanged

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 22 gate**: BRD-02 (app icon) requires user to provide Figma export before Phase 22 can execute — Phase 22 is explicitly last for this reason
- **FIX-01 root cause**: summary-hook.py exists but is NOT registered in HookInstaller — TTS never fires for existing users; this is the critical bug Phase 20 fixes
