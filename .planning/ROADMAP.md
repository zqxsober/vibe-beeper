# Roadmap: Claumagotchi

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.1 Polish + Hardening** - Phases 1-4 (shipped 2026-03-20)

## Overview

v1.1 hardened the foundation. v2.0 Voice Loop added hands-free voice I/O and auto-speak summaries. v3.0 Public Launch makes CC-Beeper ready for strangers: code cleanup removes all hardcoded paths, onboarding guides first-time users through permissions and setup, a rich menu bar popover replaces the old dropdown, voice recording is upgraded to Groq Whisper, visual polish completes the Code Beeper aesthetic, DMG packaging enables one-click distribution, and a landing-style GitHub README drives discovery on HN/Reddit/Twitter.

## Phase Details

### Phase 12: Code Quality
**Goal**: The codebase is clean, portable, and warning-free — no hardcoded user paths, no dead assets, no compiler noise
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: CODE-01, CODE-02, CODE-03, CODE-04, CODE-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. App builds and runs on a machine that is not /Users/vcartier/ — no crash or missing asset from hardcoded paths
  2. No shell-*.png files exist in Sources/shells/ — old egg assets fully removed
  3. Xcode builds with zero warnings (Sendable, unused variables, all categories)
  4. Vibration/buzz behavior is managed by a dedicated BuzzService — no inline buzz logic scattered across views
  5. Each Swift file contains exactly one type, files are consistently named to match their type
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 12-01-PLAN.md — Remove hardcoded paths, delete dead shell assets, fix compiler warnings
- [ ] 12-02-PLAN.md — Extract BuzzService, split multi-type files into one-type-per-file

### Phase 13: Onboarding
**Goal**: First-time users are guided through everything they need to start using CC-Beeper — no manual Terminal commands, no confusion
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: ONBD-01, ONBD-02, ONBD-03, ONBD-04, ONBD-05, ONBD-06, ONBD-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On first launch, a separate onboarding window opens automatically before the beeper widget appears
  2. User can see step-by-step progress: welcome → CLI detection + hooks → permissions → voice download → success
  3. The Claude Code CLI detection toggle turns green when the CLI is found and hooks are installed
  4. Permission toggles (Accessibility, Microphone, Speech Recognition) redirect to System Settings and turn green when granted; user can skip
  5. On success screen, user sees "Restart Claude Code to activate hooks" instruction
  6. App copies itself to /Applications on first launch (wherever it was opened from)
  7. "Setup..." entry in the menu bar re-opens the onboarding window at any time
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 13-01-PLAN.md — Create ClaudeDetector, HookInstaller, AppMover services + bundle hook script
- [ ] 13-02-PLAN.md — Build OnboardingViewModel, container view, and all 5 step screens + remove NotificationManager
- [ ] 13-03-PLAN.md — Wire onboarding into app lifecycle, add menu bar Setup entry, verify flow

### Phase 14: Menu Bar Popover
**Goal**: The menu bar icon opens a rich popover panel that replaces the old dropdown — all settings and controls in one place
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: MENU-01, MENU-02, MENU-03, MENU-04, MENU-05, MENU-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Clicking the menu bar icon opens a popover panel (not a dropdown menu)
  2. Quick toggles at the top of the popover control YOLO mode, mute/sound, widget visibility, and quit
  3. Advanced settings section exposes theme picker, dark mode, auto-speak, vibration, and notifications
  4. Permissions section shows live status for each permission and lets users re-trigger them from the popover
  5. About section shows the app version and a clickable GitHub link
  6. "Setup..." and "Download Voices..." entries are present and functional in the popover
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 14-01-PLAN.md — Replace dropdown with popover panel: quick actions, theme dots, dark mode, Setup/Quit + wire Settings window scene
- [ ] 14-02-PLAN.md — Build Settings window sections: Audio, Permissions (live polling), Voice, About + human verification

### Phase 15: Voice Fixes
**Goal**: On-device voice works reliably by default; optional BYOK API keys (Groq Whisper for transcription, OpenAI for TTS) unlock higher quality; keys are stored securely in Keychain and configurable in Settings and onboarding
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: VOICE-05, VOICE-06, VOICE-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. With no API keys set, pressing Speak records and transcribes using on-device SFSpeechRecognizer (no regression)
  2. With a Groq API key set, pressing Speak records a WAV file and sends it to Groq Whisper API for transcription
  3. With an OpenAI API key set, TTS uses the OpenAI API instead of AVSpeechSynthesizer
  4. API keys are stored in macOS Keychain, editable in Settings > Voice, and promptable in an optional onboarding step
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 15-01-PLAN.md — Create KeychainService, GroqTranscriptionService, and add API Keys section to Settings Voice panel
- [ ] 15-02-PLAN.md — Wire Groq path into VoiceService, OpenAI path into TTSService, add onboarding API Keys step

### Phase 16: Visual Polish
**Goal**: CC-Beeper looks and feels finished — deep rename from Claumagotchi, LCD bounce animation, dark mode verification, button feedback, vibration fixes, Xcode-style Settings sidebar
**Depends on**: Phase 14, Phase 15
**Requirements**: VFX-01, VFX-02, VFX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All references to "Claumagotchi" replaced with "CC-Beeper" (bundle ID, binary, Package.swift, user-facing strings, hook scripts, build scripts)
  2. Pixel character does a quick vertical bounce when LCD state changes (retro feel, not text crossfade)
  3. Dark mode shell variants display correctly with the LCD overlay — no tinting artifacts or misalignment
  4. Every button produces identical PNG-swap press feedback on tap
  5. Clicking the beeper window stops the current vibration; window remains draggable during shake
  6. Settings window has Xcode-style sidebar with 4 tabs (Audio, Permissions, Voice, About)
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 16-01-PLAN.md — Deep rename Claumagotchi to CC-Beeper across all files, add IPC/Keychain migration
- [ ] 16-02-PLAN.md — VFX polish (bounce, dark mode, button feedback) + vibration bug fixes
- [ ] 16-03-PLAN.md — Settings window Xcode-style sidebar with NavigationSplitView

### Phase 17: Distribution
**Goal**: Anyone can download and install CC-Beeper in under 60 seconds — no Gatekeeper warnings, no manual drag-to-Applications
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: DIST-01, DIST-02, DIST-03, DIST-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `make dmg` produces a signed DMG with the app icon and an /Applications symlink
  2. The DMG artifact is attached to a GitHub Release automatically via the release workflow
  3. Opening the app on a clean Mac with no developer tools passes Gatekeeper — no "unidentified developer" warning
  4. On first launch from the DMG, the app copies itself to /Applications without user having to drag it manually
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 18: GitHub README
**Goal**: The GitHub repository looks like a product landing page — a stranger visiting it immediately understands what CC-Beeper is and wants to install it
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: GH-01, GH-02, GH-03, GH-04, GH-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. README opens with a hero GIF showing the beeper reacting to a live Claude Code session
  2. A feature grid with icons covers the four pillars: monitoring, voice, permissions, themes
  3. A one-liner install command and a DMG download link are prominently placed above the fold
  4. Screenshots of all 8 shell color themes are displayed in the README
  5. A contributing guide and license section are present at the bottom
**Plans**: TBD

## Progress

**Execution Order:** 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 (parallel with 13-14) → 16 → 17 → 18

Note: Phase 15 (Voice Fixes) depends only on Phase 12 and can be executed in parallel with Phases 13-14. Phase 16 waits for both 14 and 15 to be complete.
