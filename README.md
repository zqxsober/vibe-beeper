## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vecartier/cc-beeper.git
cd cc-beeper
make install
```

`make install` builds the app, installs the Claude Code hooks, and launches CC-Beeper. Requires Swift (via Xcode Command Line Tools).

## What is CC-Beeper?

CC-Beeper is a floating macOS widget that lives on your desktop like a retro pager — updating its LCD display in real time as Claude Code works across your sessions. No tab-switching. No terminal watching. Just a glanceable companion that tells you what Claude is doing and lets you respond instantly.

| State | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| **THINKING** | Claude is working — tool calls, file edits, reasoning in progress |
| **DONE** | Claude finished. Your next message is waiting. |
| **NEEDS YOU** | Claude needs permission to run a tool. Approve or deny from the widget. |

## How it works

CC-Beeper uses Claude Code's [hooks system](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) to monitor sessions. A lightweight Python hook receives events from Claude Code and writes them to a shared IPC directory. The macOS app watches those files and updates instantly.

```
Claude Code  ──►  Hook (Python)  ──►  ~/.claude/cc-beeper/events.jsonl  ──►  CC-Beeper.app
                       │                                                        │
                  Permission? ───►  ~/.claude/cc-beeper/pending.json  ─────────►  Show NEEDS YOU
                       ▲                                                        │
                       └────────  ~/.claude/cc-beeper/response.json  ◄─────────┘
```

## Important disclaimer

> CC-Beeper lets you approve or deny Claude Code tool requests directly from the widget. **You are responsible for reviewing what you approve.** Clicking "Allow" grants Claude Code permission to execute the requested action on your machine.
>
> **YOLO mode** automatically approves every permission request without prompting. When enabled, Claude Code will execute all tool calls — including file modifications, shell commands, and network requests — without asking for confirmation. **Use YOLO mode at your own risk.**
>
> The authors are not liable for any damage, data loss, or unintended consequences. By using CC-Beeper, you accept these risks.
