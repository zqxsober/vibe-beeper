## What is CC-Beeper?

CC-Beeper is a floating macOS desktop widget that shows you what Claude Code is doing across all your sessions — and lets you respond without touching the terminal. It sits on screen like a retro pager, updating its LCD display in real time.

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| THINKING | Claude is working — tool calls, file edits, reasoning |
| DONE | Claude finished and is waiting for your next message |
| NEEDS YOU | Claude needs permission to run a tool |

## How it works

CC-Beeper uses Claude Code's [hooks system](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) to monitor sessions. A Python hook script receives events from Claude Code and writes them to a shared IPC directory. The macOS app watches those files and updates in real time.

```
Claude Code  ──►  Hook (Python)  ──►  /tmp/cc-beeper/*.jsonl  ──►  CC-Beeper.app
                       │                                                │
                  Permission? ───►  /tmp/cc-beeper/pending.json ───────►  Show NEEDS YOU
                       ▲                                                │
                       └────────  /tmp/cc-beeper/response.json  ◄──────┘
```

## Important disclaimer

> CC-Beeper lets you approve or deny Claude Code tool requests directly from the widget. **You are responsible for reviewing what you approve.** Clicking "Allow" grants Claude Code permission to execute the requested action on your machine.
>
> **YOLO mode** automatically approves every permission request without prompting. When enabled, Claude Code will execute all tool calls — including file modifications, shell commands, and network requests — without asking for confirmation. **Use YOLO mode at your own risk.**
>
> The authors are not liable for any damage, data loss, or unintended consequences. By using CC-Beeper, you accept these risks.
